e Whatare the pre-, post- and during flood management activities?

> Pre-Flood:
1. Build an emergency kit: This involves gathering essential supplies like food, water, medication, and
important documents.
2. Don't build in risky areas: Avoid living in places prone to flooding. If you do, make sure your home
is strong and elevated.
3. Protect your home: Put important things like heaters and electric panels higher up. Install devices
to stop water from getting into your house.

> During the flood:
1. Stay informed: Listen to the radio or TV for news about the flood.
2. Be prepared to evacuate: Be ready to move to higher ground, if necessary, especially in the event
of flash flooding, and follow evacuation orders from authorities promptly.
3. Exercise caution: Avoid driving or walking through flooded areas, as even shallow water can pose a
significant risk. Be aware of the potential for additional flooding or flash floods.

> Post-flood management:
1. Stay away from floodwaters: Avoid contact with floodwaters as they may contain contaminants
and hazards.
2. Wait for clearance: Don't go back home until it's safe. Let the experts do their job.
3. Exercise caution when returning home: Be cautious when entering buildings, as there may be
hidden damage, particularly to foundations. Avoid standing water and debris, and be aware of
weakened structures.
